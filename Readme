RVSAO -- An IRAF package to obtain radial velocities from spectra
 
The package RVSAO defined in this directory was developed by Jessica Mink at
the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics from the redshift package
originally written by Gerard Kriss at Johns Hopkins University and modified
significantly by Steve Levine at the University of Wisconsin.  It obtains
radial velocities and velocity dispersions using cross-correlation methods
or emission line fits.  It consists of several SPP tasks:
XCSAO and PXCSAO to cross-correlate spectra,
EMSAO and PEMSAO to find emission lines in spectra,
BCVCORR to compute solar system barycentric velocity correction,
SUMSPEC to add and/or modify spectra,
LINESPEC to creat synthetic emission line templates,
EQWIDTH to compute equivalent widths of lines in spectra,
WLRANGE Return the wavelength overlap range for a list of spectra
LISTSPEC List pixel, wavelength, delta wavelength, and/or pixel value for spectrum image
PIX2WL Compute the wavelength at a given pixel in a spectrum
WL2PIX Compute the pixel at a given wavelength in a spectrum
VELSET Artificially change the redshift of (log-wavelength) spectra
plus several CL scripts.

If you have any problems, please contact Jessica Mink, jmink@cfa.harvard.edu.

A task, RELEARN, has been provided to aid in updating parameters.  Run it
instead of UNLEARN to keep your current parameters settings while adding
new parameters.  It can fail when parameters are dropped; just re-run it
until it works, and things will be OK.

A set of templates commonly used at the CfA is included in the Templates/
subdirectory.  Someday, there will be documentation about them.

After the Revision Notes, you will find installation instructions.

A fairly complete description of this package has been published in the
August 1998 issue of the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the
Pacific:

* Edit cosmic rays out of a spectrum by resetting a point at a time
* (using the , key) or by linearly interpolating between points on
* either side of a cosmic ray (using the d key twice).  The edited
* spectrum is automatically written out if you are running qplot or
* are saving information to the spectrum header and leave with "q".

         the program.  Clean up exposure scaling.

See the NEWS file for the earlier history of the software.

***************************************************************************

To install this package in your local IRAF system, take the following steps:
 
1)	The package is distributed as a tar archive; IRAF is distributed
	with a tar reader.  The tar archive may be obtained by magnetic
	tape or anonymous ftp.  For magnetic tape go to step [2] and when
	reading the tar archive simply mount the tape and use the tape
	device name for the archive name in step [4].  To obtain the package
	via ftp (assuming a UNIX computer):

	    % ftp cfa-ftp.harvard.edu
	    login: anonymous
	    password: [your user name]
	    ftp> cd pub/iraf
	    ftp> get rvsao-2.8.0.readme
	    ftp> binary
	    ftp> get rvsao-2.8.0.tar.gz
	    ftp> quit
	    % ls -l
	    -rw-r--r--  1 mink          xxxx xxx xx xx:xx rvsao-2.8.0.readme
	    -rw-r--r--  1 mink        xxxxxx xxx xx xx:xx rvsao-2.8.0.tar.gz
	    %

2)	Create a directory to contain the RVSAO external package files.  This
	directory should be outside the IRAF directory tree and must be owned
	by the IRAF account.  In the following examples, this root directory
	is /local/rvsao/.  Make the appropriate file name substitutions for
        your site.
 
3)	Log in as IRAF and edit the extern.pkg file in the hlib directory to
	define the package to the CL.  From the IRAF account, outside the CL,
	you can move to this directory with the command:

            % cd $hlib

	Define the environment variable rvsao to be the pathname to the rvsao
	root directory.  UNIX pathnames must be terminated with a '/'.
	Edit extern.pkg to include:

            reset rvsao	= <directory>/rvsao-2.8.0/
            task  rvsao.pkg   = rvsao$rvsao.cl

	or, to avoid conflicts with earlier versions or the IRAF rv package,

            reset r2rvsao	= <directory>/rvsao-2.8.0/
            task  r2rvsao.pkg   = r2rvsao$r2rvsao.cl
 
	Near the end of the hlib$extern.pkg file, update the definition
	of helpdb so it includes the rvsao help database, copying the syntax
	already used in the string.  Add this line before the line containing
	a closing quote:
 
	    ,rvsao$lib/helpdb.mip\

	or, if using r2rvsao,
 
	    ,r2rvsao$lib/helpdb2.mip\
 
4)      Add to hlib$clpackage.men the package description:
 
            rvsao - Radial velocity package from SAO
 
	or, if using r2rvsao,
 
            r2rvsao - Radial velocity package from SAO
 
5)	Unpack the tar file into the RVSAO root directory.

	On a UNIX system, where ftpdir is the pathname of the directory
	into which the package was ftp'ed and rvsao is the RVSAO root
	directory:
	    % cd $rvsao (or $r2rvsao)
	    % cd ..
	    % zcat $ftpdir/rvsao-2.8.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -

	The archive file can be deleted once the package has been
	successfully installed.
 
6)      Restart IRAF and "cd rvsao" or "cd r2rvsao".

7)	Symbolically link the appropriate binary directory to bin.
	bin is originally linked to bin.generic for distribution.

        On a SPARCstation running Solaris, type
	    cl> mkpkg ssun

        On a PC running Redhat Linux, type
	    cl> mkpkg redhat

        On an Apple Macintosh running OS X on an Intel processor, type
	    cl> mkpkg macintel

        On an Apple Macintosh running OS X, type
	    cl> mkpkg macosx

        On a PC running Cygwin, type
	    cl> mkpkg cygwin

        On a PC running Linux, type
	    cl> mkpkg linux

	For other architectures, make a directory of the proper bin.{arch}
	name, and link it to bin

8)      Make the package by typing
	    cl> mkpkg update >&spool

	The spool file should be reviewed upon completion to make sure
	there were no errors.

9)	Up-to-date hypertext help is available on the World Wide Web at
